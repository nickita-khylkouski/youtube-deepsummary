-- üîç Channel Deletion Verification Queries
-- Run these SQL queries in Supabase after deleting a channel to verify complete deletion
-- Just replace '@your_handle' with the actual handle you deleted (e.g., '@metalsole')

-- ==================================================
-- ‚ö° SUPER QUICK ONE-LINER (Copy-Paste Ready)
-- ==================================================
-- Replace '@your_handle' with actual handle like '@metalsole' and run:

/*
WITH ch AS (SELECT channel_id FROM youtube_channels WHERE handle = '@your_handle')
SELECT 'Channel' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM ch
UNION ALL SELECT 'Videos', COUNT(*) FROM youtube_videos WHERE channel_id IN (SELECT channel_id FROM ch)
UNION ALL SELECT 'Chats', COUNT(*) FROM chat_conversations WHERE channel_id IN (SELECT channel_id FROM ch) OR original_channel_id IN (SELECT channel_id FROM ch);
*/

-- ==================================================
-- üéØ AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION BY HANDLE
-- ==================================================
-- Replace '@your_handle' with the actual handle like '@metalsole'
-- The queries will automatically find the channel ID
